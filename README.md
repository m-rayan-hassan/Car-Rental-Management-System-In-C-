# Car Rental Management System 🚗💻  

Welcome to the **Car Rental Management System** repository! This C++ project simulates a car rental system, allowing administrators to manage cars and customers to rent and return vehicles. It’s a great example of **file handling and structured programming** in C++.  

---

## **Features**  

### **Admin Functions**  
- Add new cars to the system.  
- Remove cars from the system.  
- View all cars, available cars, and rented cars.  

### **Customer Functions**  
- Create a new account and log in securely.  
- View all cars and available cars for rent.  
- Rent and return cars with ease.  

### **File Handling**  
- Data is stored in text files for persistence:  
  - `Car_List.txt`: Stores all cars.  
  - `Available_Cars.txt`: Stores available cars.  
  - `Rented_Cars.txt`: Stores rented cars.  
  - `Customer_List.txt`: Stores customer login details.

## **How to Use**  

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-rental-system.git  
   ```  

2. **Compile and Run:**  
   - Use a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to compile the code:  
     ```bash  
     g++ main.cpp -o car_rental_system  
     ```  
   - Run the executable:  
     ```bash  
     ./car_rental_system  
     ```  

3. **Follow the Menu:**  
   - Choose between **Admin** or **Customer** roles.  
   - Use the menu options to perform actions like adding cars, renting cars, or viewing available cars.

## **File Structure**  

```  
car-rental-system/  
├── main.cpp               # Main program file  
├── Car_List.txt           # Stores all cars  
├── Available_Cars.txt     # Stores available cars  
├── Rented_Cars.txt        # Stores rented cars  
├── Customer_List.txt      # Stores customer login details  
└── README.md              # Project documentation  
```

## **What I Learned**  
- **C++ Programming:** Built a structured system using functions and file handling.  
- **File Handling:** Used text files for data persistence and management.  
- **System Design:** Created a user-friendly interface with clear menus and error handling.  

---

## **Future Improvements**  
- Refactor the code to use **object-oriented programming (OOP)** for better organization.  
- Add a **graphical user interface (GUI)** for better user experience.  
- Integrate a **database** (e.g., SQLite) for more efficient data management.  
- Implement additional features like payment processing or car search filters.
